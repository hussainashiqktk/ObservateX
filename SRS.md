# Software Requirements Specification

## Introduction
The goal of this software project is to create a web application that trains people for observation skills and visual memory capacity. The application will take a photo, identify some objects, hide them, then ask the user to identify the missing objects. This will help users to improve their visual memory and observation skills.

## User Requirements
### User Groups
There are two user groups:

1. General users: Individuals who want to improve their observation skills and visual memory capacity.
2. Administrators: System administrators who can manage user accounts, view user statistics, and perform other administrative tasks.

### User Stories
- As a general user, I want to be able to sign up for an account so that I can use the application.
- As a general user, I want to be able to log in to my account so that I can use the application.
- As a general user, I want to be able to select a photo to use for training.
- As a general user, I want to be able to see the objects that have been identified in the photo.
- As a general user, I want to be able to practice identifying the missing objects.
- As a general user, I want to be able to track my progress over time.
- As an administrator, I want to be able to manage user accounts.
- As an administrator, I want to be able to view user statistics.

## User Interface
The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions on how to use the application.

## Functional Requirements
### Account Management
- Users can sign up for an account using their email address and password.
- Users can log in to their account using their email address and password.
- Administrators can manage user accounts, including creating and deleting accounts.

### Photo Selection
- Users can select a photo from their device to use for training.
- The application can identify objects in the photo and display them to the user.

### Training
- The application can hide some of the identified objects in the photo.
- The user can practice identifying the missing objects.
- The application can track the user's progress over time.

### Statistics
- The application can display statistics for each user, including the number of training sessions, success rate, and improvement over time.
- Administrators can view statistics for all users.

## Non-functional Requirements
### Performance
- The application should load quickly and respond to user interactions in a timely manner.
- The application should be able to handle multiple concurrent users.

### Security
- User passwords should be stored securely.
- User data should be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- The application should be protected against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

### Compatibility
- The application should be compatible with modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- The application should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Conclusion
This SRS outlines the requirements for the development of a web application that trains people for observation skills and visual memory capacity. The application will allow users to select a photo, identify some objects, hide them, and then practice identifying the missing objects. It will also track user progress over time and provide statistics for each user. The application should meet the non-functional requirements related to performance, security, and compatibility.
